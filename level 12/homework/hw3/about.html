            <h1>NETFLIX</h1>
            <p>Netflix is a streaming service that offers a wide variety of award-winning TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more on thousands of internet-connected devices. <br>

            You can watch as much as you want, whenever you want without a single commercial – all for one low monthly price. There's always something new to discover and new TV shows and movies are added every week!</p>
            <h2><i>How to change your plan</i></h2>
            <p>You can change your Netflix plan by following these steps: <br> <br>

Go to the Change Plan page in a browser. You may need to sign in if you haven't already. <br> <br>

Choose the plan you'd like, then select Continue or Update. <br> <br>

If you don't have the option to change your plan, see "Can't change plan" below. <br> <br>

Tap or click Confirm Change or Confirm. <br> <br>

Changing to a higher-priced plan takes effect immediately so you can enjoy all of the added features. Your billing date may change based on the remaining balance of your last payment, or you may be charged a prorated amount for the balance.
<br><br>
Changing to a lower-priced plan takes effect on your next billing date. You can continue to use the features of the higher-priced plan until then.
<br><br>
Note: If you have Netflix through a partner package or package add-on, search our Help Center for the article on your partner to find details on plan change timing and eligibility.</p>
            <h2><i>How to remove payment methods from your account</i></h2>
            <p>To remove a payment method from your account, go to the Manage payment info page and Delete the payment method you want to remove. You may need to sign in if you haven’t already.
<br><br>
If you only have one payment method on file, you can't remove it without adding a new payment method first. When a payment method is removed from your account, Netflix will no longer be able to charge that payment method unless it is re-added to your Netflix account.
<br><br>
If you have Netflix through a partner package and wish to remove a backup payment method, contact us for help.

<br><br>
Customer Service is unable to remove a specific payment method from your account. However, we can remove all payment methods as long as you are not paying through a partner or with a gift card. Once removed, you can add a new payment method to your account before your current billing period ends if you want to continue using Netflix.
<br><br>
Note:Some third-party payment methods cannot be removed from accounts.
<br><br>
If you have questions about data deletion or retention, contact privacy@netflix.com.</p>
            <h2><i>Netflix Gift Cards</i></h2>
            <p>Netflix gift cards are not currently sold in your country. If you purchased a Netflix gift card in a different country, you can use it as long as you pay for Netflix in the same currency as the gift card.
<br><br>
For more information, use the picklist above to select the country where the gift card was purchased.
<br><br>
Note: In order to use the gift card, you will need to add a second payment method.
